# NYC_Yellow_Cab_Tip_Prediction

Yellow Taxi Cabs are one of the significant modes of transportation in New York City. The number of daily
taxi trips in the city that never sleeps amounts to almost half a million. This gives us plenty of information
to understand what features (besides the quality of the driver) actually affect the tip received by a cab driver.
After examining quite an extensive data set, we have come up with a set of features that affect the tipping
amount which in turn would help the drivers redefine their business model. Using this feature set, we try
and predict the amount of the tip. Multiple models are trained and compared using the RMSE values to
choose the best model for our task.
According to our findings the best model for our task is Decision tree regressor which gives a RMSE
value of 0.74 and a list of features that were best for our task has been found in the following sections.
